# Vela Scheduler Experiments

Vela Scheduler comes with an extensive set of experiment suites to allow assessing its scalability and performance.
A detailed list of all experiment suites can be found [here](https://github.com/polaris-slo-cloud/vela-scheduler/tree/master/testbed).

In March 2023 an extensive set of experiments was conducted on a supercluster consisting of 10 subclusters of varying sizes, using our [automated suite of experiments](https://github.com/polaris-slo-cloud/vela-scheduler/tree/master/testbed/automated-multi-vm-fake-kubelet-multi-cluster).
The results of these experiments can be found [here](./2023-03).
